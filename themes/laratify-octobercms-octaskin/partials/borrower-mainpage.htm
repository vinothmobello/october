      <h6>Working Capital Loans</h6>
      <p>Working capital is the operating liquidity available to a business. When not managed carefully, businesses can grow themselves out of cash by needing more working capital to fulfill expansion plans than they can generate in their current state.</p>

      <h6>Asset-Backed Financing (Leasing)</h6>
      <p>We understand that businesses have to innovate in order to maintain their competitive edge. To meet this need, an ever increasing number of enterprises are opting to lease in order to protect their capital and safeguard liquidity.</p>

      <h6>Secured Financing</h6>
      <p>Companies that have unencumbered assets are able to use them as collateral in order to get additional financing in the form of secured loans. Another type of secured financing is bridging loans, where future proceeds from a property sale can be pledged in order to raise capital in advance.</p>
